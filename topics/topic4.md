## hello, so you should have equipment and resources to biuld a wind turbine as of completing the last step so let's build it.

## design


of course we have to have an idea, it is probably easier if you draw it out first to give yourself a guide but i didn't, deciding on your design will depend on the average airspeed, faster air will allow smaller faster spinning blades while slower air will require larger slower blades

here are my 2 as examples

***NOTE.*** *the small one I created had a number of materials from my own resources* ***not*** *from the materials included.*

designing this will require a frame of some sort to mount the motor and bladesthe height of this should be determined by the amount of air this turbine will interact with, a taller tower for less wind speed and a shorter tower for higher wind speed, this will make it easier to stabalise. 

we also of course need the blades to vary in size to catch the air at different speeds, similarly to the tower larger blades will catch more air and therefore require less air and the opposite applies to the smaller blades.

## let's build it

now you have a design or an idea where you want to end up we can start on blades, I used a cup cut into 4 as i only used one cup for the the tower and got 4 blades from it (2 were given to someone else), they're quite easy to see on the back of my longer blades or as the shorter blades on my small turbine



we can start building a tower, something with a fairly wide base, tall enough for your blades to spin freely and somewhere to mount myou motor and blades so that again the blades spin freely

simple enough right?
creating mine I needed to tweak it a bit but eventually got it to work well at quite a distance
