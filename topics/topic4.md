# hello, so you should have equipment and resources to biuld a wind turbine as of completing the last step so let's build it.

## design

of course we have to have an idea, it is more effective if you draw it out first but i didn't, deciding on your design will depend on the average air velocity, faster air will allow smaller faster spinning blades while slower air will require larger slower blades

designing this will require a frame of some sort to mount the motor and bladesthe height of this should be determined by the amount of air this turbine will interact with, a taller tower for less wind speed and a shorter tower for higher wind speed, this will make it easier to stabalise. 

we also of course need the blades to vary in size to catch the air at different speeds, similarly to the tower larger blades will catch more air and therefore require less air and the opposite applies to the smaller blades.

now you have a design or an idea where you want to end up we can start building a tower
