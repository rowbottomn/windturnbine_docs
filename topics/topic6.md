Void setup is what makes sure everything works and what starts the code.
T
Void loop is what will show us the voltage, it will keep on running until we turn it off. Line 6 takes in our numbers in what we call sensorValue. Line 7 converts the sensorValue numbers into voltage numbers. Line 8 shows us the numbers in voltage and graphs it.

## Sample code will be ready for use

Once you have everything setup to your computer, your ready to run the code!
